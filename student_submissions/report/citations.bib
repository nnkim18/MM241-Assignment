 abstract = {In earlier papers [Opns. Res. 9, 849-859 (1961), and 11, 863-888 (1963)] the one-dimensional cutting stock problem was discussed as a linear programming problem. There it was shown how the difficulty of the enormous number of columns occurring in the linear programming formulation could be overcome by solving a knapsack problem at every pivot step. In this paper higher dimensional cutting stock problems are discussed as linear programming problems. The corresponding difficulty of the number of columns cannot in general be overcome for there is no efficient method for solving the generalized knapsack problem of the higher dimensional problem. However a wide class of cutting stock problems of industry have restrictions that permit their generalized knapsack problem to be efficiently solved. All of the cutting stock problems that yield to this treatment are ones in which the cutting is done in stages. In treating these practical cutting problems, one often encounters additional conditions that affect the solution. An example of this occurs in the cutting of corrugated boxes, which involves an auxiliary sequencing problem. This problem is discussed in some detail, and a solution described for the sequencing problem under given simplifying assumptions.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on guillotine cuts which often arise in real-life cutting stock problems. In order to construct a solution verifying guillotine constraints, the first step is to know how to determine whether a given cutting pattern is a guillotine pattern. For this purpose, we first characterize guillotine patterns by proving a necessary and sufficient condition. Then, we propose a polynomial algorithm to check this condition. Based on this mathematical characterization of guillotine patterns, we then show that guillotine constraints can be formulated into linear inequalities. The performance of the algorithm to check guillotine cutting patterns is evaluated by means of computational results.}

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the two-dimensional Variable-Sized Cutting Stock Problem (2D-VSCSP) with guillotine constraint, applied to the home textile industry. This is a challenging class of real-world problems where, given a set of predefined widths of fabric rolls and a set of piece types, the goal is to decide the widths and lengths of the fabric rolls to be produced, and to generate the cutting patterns to cut all demanded pieces. Each piece type considered has a rectangular shape with a specific width and length and a fixed demand to be respected. The main objective function is to minimize the total amount of the textile materials produced/cut to satisfy the demand. According to Wäscher, Haußner, & Schumann (2007), the addressed problem is a Cutting Stock Problem (CSP), as the demand for each item is greater than one. However, in the real-world application at stake, the demand for each item type is not very high (below ten for all item types). Therefore, addressing the problem as a Bin-Packing Problem (BPP), in which all items are considered to be different and have a unitary demand, was a possibility. For this reason, two approaches to solve the problems were devised, implemented, and tested: (1) a CSP model, based on the well-known Lodi and Monaci (2003) model (3 variants), and (2) an original BPP-based model. Our research shows that, for this level of demand, the new BPP model is more competitive than CSP models. We analyzed these different models and described their characteristics, namely the size and the quality of the linear programming relaxation bound for solving the basic mono-objective variant of the problem. We also propose an ϵ−constraint approach to deal with a bi-objective extension of the problem, in which the number of cutting patterns used must also be minimized. The quality of the models was evaluated through computational experiments on randomly generated instances, yielding promising results.}

abstract = {The common staged patterns are always required during the cutting process for separating a set of rectangular items from rectangular plates in manufacturing industries. Two-staged patterns can reduce cutting complexity at the expense of material utilization; three-staged patterns do the opposite. Combining these two types of staged patterns may be a good balance for two contradictory objectives of material utilization and cutting complexity. A heuristic approach is proposed to solve the two-dimensional rectangular cutting stock problem with a combination of two-staged general patterns (2SGP) and three-staged homogenous patterns (3SHP). Firstly, the 2SGP and 3SHP are constructed by using recursive techniques. The pattern with the larger value is selected as the candidate pattern. Then, the value of each item is corrected according to the current candidate pattern. A cutting plan accurately satisfying all items demand is obtained by using the sequential heuristic algorithm. Finally, the cutting plan with a minimum number of used plates is achieved by applying the iterative algorithm. The computational results indicate that the proposed heuristic approach is more effective in material utilization and cutting complexity than the two published algorithms with staged patterns.},

abstract = { In this study, we consider a two-dimensional cutting stock problem with multiple stock sizes and two-stage guillotine cuts. Our objective is to maximise the difference between total revenue earned over all cut items and total cost spent over all used panels. We propose two mathematical models, derive some optimality properties and use them to enhance the performances of the models. We develop decomposition-based heuristics that use the best of the proposed models to solve the subproblems. The results of our computational study have revealed that the models can return optimal solutions for the instances with up to 30 items in two hours and the heuristics produce near-optimal solutions for the instances with up to 50 items in five minutes. }
